      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi! I'm Uma, and I'm about to enter 9th grade. I'm passionate about
        reading novels, running, hanging out with friends, coding, and learning
        new things. Literature has always been a gateway to new worlds for me,
        where I can explore different perspectives and immerse myself in
        captivating stories.
      </p>
      <p>
        Running, particularly Cross Country, is another significant part of my
        life. It keeps me physically fit and mentally strong. The discipline and
        endurance required for long-distance running have taught me valuable
        life lessons. Coding is my creative outlet. It allows me to solve
        problems, build projects, and continuously improve my skills. Whether
        it's developing a new game or learning a new programming language, I
        find immense joy in the world of coding.
